    From Oleg Dedkow:
    The recent NVCC version (V2.1 beta for 64-Bit Windows Vista) cannot be used from VS 2008 environment to compile "cu" files containing both CUDA functions and C++ classes.
    The file "kernel.cu" has been splitted in two parts: CUDA and C++ respectively. This should solve the problem of compiling the cuda example on 64Bit Windows systems.

    - New Modules:
       -- UnitInOutModule processing units can now be loaded from .so/.dll modules
       -- UnitCamera - bring additional cameras into the osgppu pipeline (usefull for multiple cameras being processed by osgPPU)
    
    - deprecated class "Shader" removed (use ShaderAttribute instead)
    - small build fixes (changed Cmake files)
    - examples do build now with osgppu_ prefix
    - support for .so version build extensions (i.e. libosgPPU.so.0.4.0)
    - new examples:
       -- ssao - simple screen space ambient occlusion
       -- glow - simple example shows how to use osgPPU to let certain objects glow)
       -- cuda - shows how to compile and use CUDA kernels together in ppu pipeline
       -- CUDA support - bring cuda kernels into osgPPU pipeline, by loading CUDA-kernel through UnitInOutModule unit (CUDA kernels has to be compiled externally into an .so/.dll file)
    
    - full support for "NodeKit" definition ;)

    On Windows, we need to have the 'd' suffix on the plugin DLL too, and the code in CMakeModules/OsgPPUMacroUtils.cmake (SETUP_PLUGIN) just removed the suffix in the NOT MSVC case, but never added it in the else... so I added that.

    - Render-to-CubeMap example added
    - the example should be extended to really changed the color values of hte input cubemap texture. However this requires transformation of texel coordinates from the cubespace into 2d space. Hence this is just a color example ;)

    double type for BoundingBox / BoundingSphere / Matrix / Plane.
    - updated CMake modules to install the library in the bin directory for
    Visual Studio (the same behaviour as OpenSceneGraph)
    - removed compiler errors in Visual Studio 2005 (Visitor.cpp /
    Visitor.h) using the ref_ptr<CleanTraverseMaskVisitor>
    - updated the CMake file of the osgPPU plug'in to take into account "Base.h"
    - updated the CMake file of the dof example to take into account "dofppu.h"
    - modified the dof and hdr example code to center the viewer window on
    the main screen

    - UnitInOut now do allocate the output texture by itself.
    - the output texture is filled with 0 values in the beginning preventing of getting unitialized values out of the texture
    - TODO: implement texture clearing with FBO to support much faster creation
    - during the initialization of UnitInOut a small stall can be percieved due to uploading of high amount of data to the GPU

    - to reflect the changes of the previous patch from bob Kuehne the Data directory is
     now located under src/examples/Data. During hte configuration of the build process
     all the data is copied into the bin/Data/ which
    - lib and bin direcotries are removed, you will find them after the build process in your current build directory
    - moved scripts to the doc directory to cleanup the main directory

Author: Art Tevs <art@tevs.eu>
Date:   Tue May 6 22:08:05 2008 +0000

    - From Bob Kuehne:
    the patch is to allow separation of build
    directory and all products (objects, apps, libraries) from the source
    directory. osg and many other related projects which use cmake work
    this way, so as to keep the source distribution 'pure' and free of
    generated files. please take a look, and integrate if you approve -
    this will bring ppu to the same baseline operation as what osg
    currently provides wrt cmake systems.

commit a84cbe30db4c7c4d578552ddaab11da272f5acd3
Author: Art Tevs <art@tevs.eu>

    - From Stephane Lamoliatte:
    - fix some compiler bugs that met on Visual Studio 2005 :
    - I change the call of the round function by osg::round because there is no standard round function in Visual studio
    - There was some encapsulation problem with the Unit class :
        Unit has Visitor for friend. CleanMaskVisitor and
    SetMaximumInputsVisitor were Visitor internal classes. In Visual studio
    CleanMaskVisitor and SetMaximumInputsVisitor  cannot access to Unit
    private variables.
        So, with the patch, Unit has CleanMaskVisitor and
    SetMaximumInputsVisitor for friend. And these two classes are not
    contained by Visitor.
    - I add some lines in FindOpenThreads.cmake to make it compatible with my environment variables (I copy/paste FindOSG.cmake).
    - I remove some useless precompiler directive in IO_Unit.cpp
    - I modify some boolean stuff in IO_Unit.cpp to avoid strange warnings about int/boolean conversion.

    - problem with the blending correct, now any unit texture clamps to the edge
    - TODO: correct implementation of removeUnit methods, since this one crashes

    - new StateAttribute - ColorAttribute added
    - it allows time specific configuration of the glColor value
    - the color is used to render the units.
    - this allows to implement blending on the units
    - hdr example the fadeIn/fadeOut effects added

    - each unit is now sorted into the same renderbin as the processor and get it sort index based on the graph counted upwards from the processor index
    - solved problem with wrongly sorted units
    - visitor do perform now a traversion during the initialization on units children in reverse order, which is needed for correct sorting
    - I think there are still some problems with the sorting during hte execution, however the results seems to be correct

Date:   Tue Apr 22 22:17:52 2008 +0000

    - sandbox merged with trunk
    - completly changed the way how Units are managed.
    - Unit and Processor are now derived from osg::Group which enables to combine them in a graph in an usual fashion
    - The subgraph under the processor represents the unit pipeline
    - No State is dierectly involved anymore, the state is acquired automatically during the rendering
    - Each parent node do provide its output to the children
    - Each child collects its inputs from all direct parents and hence setup itself in this way
    - Cycles in the unit graph are allowed, giving the possibility of reusing computed data in the next frames
    - Cycles are resolved by adding special kind of node BarrierNodes, which disables the traversion at them
    - Processor uses now a special kind of Visitor to Setup, Initialize, Resolve Cycle, Optimize, Update and Draw the subgraph of units
    - The .ppu files has not to contain fixed Viewports, allowing reusing of the same .ppu file for different camera resolutions
    - New UnitTexture unit allowing passing an external texture as input into the ppu graph
    - Shader uniforms are setted up automatically based on the input textures
    - The .ppu file can now write and read every kind of Unit including external texture referencies
    - All examples were updated and changed to the new interface

    - Some bugs and issues with the new driver corrected
    - In example changed all the occurencies of texture2DLod to texture2D
      Due to some bugs either in the driver or somewhere else texture2D
      do not read from the level 0 per default.
    - Therefor had to add glTexParameteri to change the base level of the texture
      for input textures in the PPUInOut.cpp
    - Maybe some patch to osg is required to control this by the stateset
    
    - Eye Adaption still do not work as one might expected, however the code is correct now.
    
    - I am not sure but better to check if ComputeLuminance mipmapshader does work properly

    - Structure of the example ppus changed. Now there is two offline ppus which
      do compute the adapted luminance value.
    
    - TODO: Adapted luminance value seems to have some problems. Will be corrected soon.
